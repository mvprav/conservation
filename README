Report Threats. Help Wildlife.

Wildlife and their habitats are threatened by several human-induced causes in different forms. Collation of these threats is difficult considering their multifariousness such as fragmentation, poaching, forest fires, timber smuggling, harvest of forest products and others. These threats cause several short-term and long-term effects on wildlife and it is extremely important to document threats for wildlife conservation and management purposes.

In this regard conservationthreats.org is an effort to help wildlife enthusiasts and common man understand threats and their impact on wildlife. It offers citizens a platform to participate in collating information about occurrences of the threats across the forests of Western Ghats in Karnataka. Established jointly by Wildlife Conservation Society-India Program and Wildlife Matters, conservationthreats.org aims to compile data about wildlife threats and occurrences by contributions of images, videos and location/s of threats from conservation enthusiasts. We envision the forum which is open to public, media, wildlife enthusiasts and policy makers would help in creating better awareness on conservation issues by mapping them based on established categories of threats.

conservationthreats.org roots from a concern over all aspects of threats that harm protection of wildlife and to reinforce an understanding of the urgent need to conserve them in their natural habitats. The location mapping of the data and the number of threats that occur in an area are broad indicators of the well being of forests and protection accorded to the species that inhabit them.
