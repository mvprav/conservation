   <p class='question'><a><b>How can the threats be stopped or curbed?</b></a></p>
   <div class='answer'>
     <p>Threats to wildlife is a serious concern for wildlife managers and conservationists. . Though all threats cannot be completely stopped it is important to bring them to tolerable limits. In most cases the Forest Department is responsible to stop the threats. However brining threats to the notice of the concerned authorities is the first step to reduce them.<br>In some cases conservation enthusiasts also take lead in curbing/stopping both minor and serious threats to wildlife conservation. </p>

   <p class='question'><a><b>What will happen to the threats reported on this site?</b></a></p>
   <div class='answer'>
     <p>Building awareness among citizens, media and others is the most important objective of this site. We also expect that individual park managers can access the site and take steps in reducing threats to wildlife. We welcome media to use the site as a source of data to understand how threats are spatially distributed.<br>More importantly we hope that conservation organisations will use the available data to raise the subject with wildlife managers, Government and others to build awareness about high intensity threats so that suitable action is taken to reduce the threats. For instance we expect information on human-wildlife conflict to be used by both Government and civil societies to monitor the extent and locations of conflict so that suitable mitigation measures could be planned.</p>
