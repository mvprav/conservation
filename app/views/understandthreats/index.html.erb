                			<p>
                				Poaching is the principal threat to wildlife 
								after habitat fragmentation. It prevails due to 
								local venison consumption and use of organs and 
								other body parts for traditional medicine. 
								Tigers, elephants and leopards are hunted to 
								meet the demand of high value wildlife products 
								such as skin, nails, bone and tusk to cater to 
								the international trade market.
                			</p>
                			<p>
                				High meat yielding large-bodied ungulates and 
								primates are the principal targets of local 
								poaching. Spotted deer, sambar, muntjacs 
								(barking deer), chevrotian (mouse deer), wild 
								pig, gaur, and smaller mammals such as giant 
								squirrel, porcupine, pangolin, civet are regular 
								targets of local poachers. Birds like pigeons, 
								hornbills, and peafowl are also not spared. The 
								impacts of poaching are ruinous. It is a threat 
								that direct reduces the number of animals in an 
								area and several species could be locally 
								stamped out due to poaching. Hunting of 
								herbivores has a direct affect on carnivores 
								numbers as they are directly dependent on them 
								for food.
                			</p>
                			<p>
                				Poachers use telephone wires and motor bike 
								cables as snares, the most popular tool for 
								hunting, that are set on forest paths regularly 
								used by animals. Snares are effectively used for 
								hunting spotted deer, sambar, barking deer, 
								mouse deer, wild pigs and other herbivores. 
								Often large, critically endangered animals like 
								tigers and leopards also get caught and die in 
								snares. Use of locally made firearms is another 
								popular form of hunting. Though many people do 
								not own a firearm, they are borrowed from others 
								with whom they share the bounty for lending 
								shotguns. Smoking out species such as 
								porcupines, pangolins out of resting burrows, 
								baited explosives are used to hunt pigs, beating 
								of drums and hunting dogs are engaged to corner 
								and hunt muntjac, wild boars and blacknaped 
								hares are all common hunting practices. Poisoned 
								water placed in broken earthen pots is used to 
								kill wildlife and large carnivores that threaten 
								livestock are poisoned to be eliminated. Water 
								holes, fruiting trees and croplands bordering 
								forests are favourite spots for hunting 
								wildlife.
                			</p>
                			<p>
                				Jaw traps are laid to hunt large carnivores like 
								tigers which have high value in the 
								international bone and skin trade market. The 
								use of jaw traps is prevalent in north India. 
								Once caught in jaw traps they are beaten with 
								clubs or speared through the mouth death to 
								obtain undamaged pelts.
