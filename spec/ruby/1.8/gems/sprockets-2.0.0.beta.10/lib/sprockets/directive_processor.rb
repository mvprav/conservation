  # A directive comment starts with a comment prefix, followed by an "=",
  # then the directive name, then any arguments.

  # The Processor is implemented as a `Tilt::Template` and is loosely
  # coupled to Sprockets. This makes it possible to disable or modify
  # the processor to do whatever you'd like. You could add your own
  # custom directives or invent your own directive syntax.
  #
  # `Environment#processors` includes `DirectiveProcessor` by default.
  #
  # To remove the processor entirely:
  #
  #     env.unregister_processor('text/css', Sprockets::DirectiveProcessor)
  #     env.unregister_processor('application/javascript', Sprockets::DirectiveProcessor)
  #
  # Then inject your own preprocessor:
  #
  #     env.register_processor('text/css', MyProcessor)
